		<p>Design student.

		I chose this path because I want to be able to put my creativity at the service of others. 
		I love sliding sports of all kinds. As soon as I have a board under my feet I am happy. I also like to travel, and both at the same time is even better! 
		I founded Oyster because it is imperative to preserve our oceans and I want to be among those who act for. </p>

		<p>I am passionate about the sea and travel. My dream is to live on a sailboat. I am very attached to the ocean since I was a child. 
		I founded Oyster because I refuse to let our oceans deteriorate before my eyes.</p>

		<p>Engineering student in Arts and Crafts in Energy Engineering. 

		I like to surf, I like to tinker, I like nature and travel. I like to imagine solutions and invent ways of doing things, try them and experience them.

		I founded Oyster to get actively involved in the current climate emergency by wanting to preserve the place where I spend most of my time; the ocean.</p>
